## About The App

Feedback form with PHP and MySQL is a simple web application that allows users to submit feedback or comments about a product, service, or website. The form collects information such as the user's name, message, priority of message, type of message and terms & conditions and then stores this data in a MySQL database. Here are some details on how the project has been created:

1. Setting up the database:
   Create a MySQL database with a table that has columns for the id, user's name, body, priority and type. The id column should be defined as primary and auto-            incremental.

2. Creating the HTML form:
   Create an HTML form that collects the user's name, message, priority of message, type of message and terms & conditions. The form should also have a submit button that sends the data to the PHP script.

3. Processing the form with PHP:
   Create a PHP script that processes the data from the HTML form. The script should validate the user's input to ensure that all required fields are filled in. Once      the data is validated, the script should insert the data into the MySQL database.

Overall, this project requires knowledge of HTML, PHP, and MySQL.
